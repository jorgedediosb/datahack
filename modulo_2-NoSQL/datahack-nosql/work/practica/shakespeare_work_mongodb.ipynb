    "He  querido probar el dataset de Shakespeare con mongodb para testear la diferencia con Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "En mis pruebas he comprobado que Mongo es mucho más eficiente que neo4j para ciertas consultas.\n",
    "\n",
    "En este Notebook he realizado consultas en Mongo para unir textos completos y ha demostrado funcionar mucho mejor que Neo4j. Con Neo4j el tiempo para estas consultas era 'desesperante' y con mongo las consultas se realizan 'instantaneamente'.\n",
    "\n",
    "La idea era probar si con Mongodb, las consultas de recopilación de texto (en cada documento json hay una línea de texto de las obras de Shakespeare) era más rápida que con Neo4j. Aunque en mi caso de uso con Neo4j no tenía planteado estos casos, pensé que en un caso real, la empresa podría solicitarlo, ¿qué haría entonces?. Tras realizar varias pruebas con Neo4j y no mostrar un rendimiento eficiente, decidí probarlo con mongodb. El resultado fue mucho mejor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Por otro lado, para las consultas planteadas en el caso de uso de Neo4j, sin recopilar los datos pensando en esas consultas, las consultas son mucho más complejas que en Neo4j. Suponngo que haciendo una recopilación de datos pensando en dichas consultas, estas serán más sencillas, pero me ha resultado que en mongodb la petición de consultas con CRUD es mucho menos intuitivo que con CYPHER.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Al NO ser este mi base de datos elegida sino Neo4j, no he utilizado ni el framework de agregación ni e indexado en las colecciones que se solicitaba. He usado Mongodb como prueba (y aprendizaje) y como complemento a mi práctica. Entiendo que haciéndolo y preparado el modelado de datos según las necesidades, las consultas podrían mejorar."

      "HAMLET: Let me not think ont--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\n",
      "HAMLET: A little month, or ere those shoes were old\n",
      "HAMLET: With which she followd my poor fathers body,\n",
      "HAMLET: Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--\n",
      "HAMLET: O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,\n",
      "HAMLET: Would have mournd longer--married with my uncle,\n",
      "HAMLET: My fathers brother, but no more like my father\n",

      "HORATIO: Season your admiration for awhile\n",
      "HORATIO: With an attent ear, till I may deliver,\n",
      "HORATIO: Upon the witness of these gentlemen,\n",
      "HORATIO: This marvel to you.\n",
      "HAMLET: For Gods love, let me hear.\n",
      "HORATIO: Two nights together had these gentlemen,\n",
      "HORATIO: Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,\n",
      "HORATIO: In the dead vast and middle of the night,\n",
      "HORATIO: Been thus encounterd. A figure like your father,\n",
      "HORATIO: Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,\n",
      "HORATIO: Appears before them, and with solemn march\n",
      "HORATIO: Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walkd\n",
      "HORATIO: By their oppressd and fear-surprised eyes,\n",
      "HORATIO: Within his truncheons length; whilst they, distilled\n",
      "HORATIO: Almost to jelly with the act of fear,\n",
      "HORATIO: Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\n",
      "HORATIO: In dreadful secrecy impart they did;\n",
      "HORATIO: And I with them the third night kept the watch;\n",
      "HORATIO: Where, as they had deliverd, both in time,\n",
      "HORATIO: Form of the thing, each word made true and good,\n",
      "HORATIO: The apparition comes: I knew your father;\n",
      "HORATIO: These hands are not more like.\n",
      "HAMLET: But where was this?\n",
      "MARCELLUS: My lord, upon the platform where we watchd.\n",
      "HAMLET: Did you not speak to it?\n",
      "HORATIO: My lord, I did;\n",
      "HORATIO: But answer made it none: yet once methought\n",
      "HORATIO: It lifted up its head and did address\n",
      "HORATIO: Itself to motion, like as it would speak;\n",
      "HORATIO: But even then the morning cock crew loud,\n",
      "HORATIO: And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\n",
      "HORATIO: And vanishd from our sight.\n",
      "HAMLET: Tis very strange.\n",
      "HORATIO: As I do live, my honourd lord, tis true;\n",
      "HORATIO: And we did think it writ down in our duty\n",
      "HORATIO: To let you know of it.\n",
      "HAMLET: Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\n",
      "HAMLET: Hold you the watch to-night?\n",
      "BERNARDO: We do, my lord.\n",
      "HAMLET: Armd, say you?\n",
      "BERNARDO: Armd, my lord.\n",
      "HAMLET: From top to toe?\n",
      "BERNARDO: My lord, from head to foot.\n",
      "HAMLET: Then saw you not his face?\n",
      "HORATIO: O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.\n",
      "HAMLET: What, lookd he frowningly?\n",
      "HORATIO: A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\n",
      "HAMLET: Pale or red?\n",
      "HORATIO: Nay, very pale.\n",
      "HAMLET: And fixd his eyes upon you?\n",
      "HORATIO: Most constantly.\n",
      "HAMLET: I would I had been there.\n",
      "HORATIO: It would have much amazed you.\n",
      "HAMLET: Very like, very like. Stayd it long?\n",
      "HORATIO: While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\n",
      "BERNARDO: Longer, longer.\n",
      "HORATIO: Not when I sawt.\n",
      "HAMLET: His beard was grizzled--no?\n",
      "HORATIO: It was, as I have seen it in his life,\n",
      "HORATIO: A sable silverd.\n",
      "HAMLET: I will watch to-night;\n",
      "HAMLET: Perchance twill walk again.\n",
      "HORATIO: I warrant it will.\n",
      "HAMLET: If it assume my noble fathers person,\n",
      "HAMLET: Ill speak to it, though hell itself should gape\n",
      "HAMLET: And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\n",
      "HAMLET: If you have hitherto conceald this sight,\n",
      "HAMLET: Let it be tenable in your silence still;\n",
      "HAMLET: And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,\n",
      "HAMLET: Give it an understanding, but no tongue:\n",
      "HAMLET: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:\n",
      "HAMLET: Upon the platform, twixt eleven and twelve,\n",
      "HAMLET: Ill visit you.\n",
      "All: Our duty to your honour.\n",
      "HAMLET: Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.\n",
      "HAMLET: My fathers spirit in arms! all is not well;\n",
      "HAMLET: I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\n",
      "HAMLET: Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\n",
      "HAMLET: Though all the earth oerwhelm them, to mens eyes.\n",
      "LAERTES: My necessaries are embarkd: farewell:\n",
      "LAERTES: And, sister, as the winds give benefit\n",
      "LAERTES: And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\n",

      "OPHELIA: Do you doubt that?\n",
      "LAERTES: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,\n",
      "LAERTES: Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\n",
      "LAERTES: A violet in the youth of primy nature,\n",
      "LAERTES: Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\n",
      "LAERTES: The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.\n",
      "OPHELIA: No more but so?\n",
      "LAERTES: Think it no more;\n",
      "LAERTES: For nature, crescent, does not grow alone\n",
      "LAERTES: In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\n",
      "LAERTES: The inward service of the mind and soul\n",
      "LAERTES: Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\n",
      "LAERTES: And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\n",
      "LAERTES: The virtue of his will: but you must fear,\n",
      "LAERTES: His greatness weighd, his will is not his own;\n",
      "LAERTES: For he himself is subject to his birth:\n",
      "LAERTES: He may not, as unvalued persons do,\n",
      "LAERTES: Carve for himself; for on his choice depends\n",
      "LAERTES: The safety and health of this whole state;\n",
      "LAERTES: And therefore must his choice be circumscribed\n",
      "LAERTES: Unto the voice and yielding of that body\n",
      "LAERTES: Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\n",
      "LAERTES: It fits your wisdom so far to believe it\n",
